# <Mini-Quiz-Challenge>

## Description

My motivation for this project was to be able to put together a basic front end and incoorporate JS functionality.
I was able to utilize event listeners to create an active front end and collect user input. It allowed me to use event listeners to obtain information and put that information in local storage and use that data to push through different functions of logic.
